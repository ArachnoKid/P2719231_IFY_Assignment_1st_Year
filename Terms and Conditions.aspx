                      <div><h2> 5. Standard eCoupon Terms and Conditions</h2>
                            <ol type="a"><li>Using eCoupons
                                <p>eCoupons can only be used online to these general terms and conditions, and any other specific conditions notified to you on the issue of an eCoupon. No eCoupon is redeemable through any website owned or operated by Edible. <br />
                                    An eCoupon is redeemed by entering its code at the appropriate point in the online purchase process. Redemption may be subject to you providing proof of entitlement to use the eCoupon.<br />
                                    Your use of an eCoupon indicates your agreement to be bound by these eCoupon Terms and Conditions.</p>
                                <li>Distribution of eCoupons
                                    <p>eCoupons are, and remain at all times, the property of Edible.<br />
                                        The right to use an eCoupon is personal to the original recipient and may not be transferred. No eCoupon may be copied, reproduced, distributed, or published directly or indirectly in any form or by any means for use by an entity other than the original recipient, or stored in a data retrieval system, without the prior written permission of Edible.<br />
                                        eCoupons distributed or circulated without the written approval of Edible, for example on an Internet message board or on a "bargains" website, are not valid for use and may be refused or cancelled.</p>
                                <li>Permitted usage of eCoupons
                                    <p>Unless expressly stated otherwise at the time of issue of the eCoupon: </p><br />
                                       <ol type="1"><li>Each issued eCoupon will be valid for use by a recipient only once,
                                                    <li>Only one eCoupon will be valid for use per customer or household, as the case may be, and,
                                                    <li>An eCoupon may not be used in conjunction with any other special offer or eCoupon.
                                        </ol><br />
                                       <p> Even where eCoupons expressly state at the time of issue that they may be used in conjunction with other eCoupons or offers, any eCoupon code beginning X may not be used in conjunction with any other eCoupon code that also begins X.<br />
                                        Even where eCoupons expressly state at the time of issue that they may be used in conjunction with other eCoupons or offers, any eCoupon code beginning TDX may not be used in conjunction with any other eCoupon code that also begins TDX.<br />
                                        eCoupons cannot be exchanged for cash or used to purchase gift-vouchers.<br />
                                        eCoupons cannot be used in conjunction with purchases from the Tesco Jersey online store</p>
                                <li>Excluded goods and services
                                    <p>Certain goods or services are excluded from all eCoupon offers. These include tobacco, infant formula milk and prescription medicines. From time to time other goods or services may be excluded and any such further exclusion will be notified to you along with the eCoupon or through the store website.<br />
                                        eCoupons may be limited to redemption in respect of certain products or services or certain products or services may be excluded from the ambit of use of the eCoupon, in which case notice will be given to you at the time of issue of the eCoupon.<br/>
                                        Excluded goods and services will not count towards any qualifying conditions for offers and will not benefit from any promotional discount.
                                    </p>
                                <li>Minimum spend requirements
                                    <p>Where the redemption of an eCoupon is subject to a minimum spending requirement, the redemption is only permitted in respect of the purchase of qualifying products which will be communicated to you at the time of issue of the eCoupon. Excluded products and supplementary charges, such as delivery, gift wrap or postage & packing, shall not count towards a minimum spending requirement.<br />
                                        If more than one minimum spend offer is valid for use in an order, there must be sufficient qualifying spend to meet the requirements of each offer in total. For example, to use a £3 off £30 eCoupon and a £5 off £50 eCoupon in the same transaction (assuming that these eCoupons can be used together), you must spend at least £80.
                                    </p>
                                <li>Calculation of discount
                                    <p>Where an online offer states that a percentage discount will be given on a purchase, the cost of the qualifying purchases will be reduced by the stated discount percentage.<br />
                                        Where purchases are stated to be offered on a "VAT-free" basis, the prices of qualifying items will be reduced by the equivalent of VAT. At the current VAT rate of 20% this equates to a discount of 16.67%.<br />
                                        Supplementary charges such as delivery or postage & packing shall not be discounted unless specifically stated in the offer description.
                                    </p>
                                <li>Security and Fraud
                                    <p>When you use an eCoupon you warrant to Edible that you are the duly authorised recipient of the eCoupon and that you are using it in good faith.<br />
                                        If you redeem, attempt to redeem or encourage the redemption of eCoupons to obtain discounts to which you or a third party are not entitled you may be committing a civil or criminal offence.<br />
                                        If we reasonably believe that any eCoupon is being used unlawfully or illegally we may reject or cancel any eCoupon and you agree that you will have no claim against us in respect of any rejection or cancellation. Edible reserves the right to take any further action it deems appropriate in such instances.
                                    </p>
                                <li>Limitation of liability
                                    <p>At all times our acceptance of an order takes place on despatch of the order, at which point the purchase contract will be made and you will be charged for your order.<br />
                                        All offers are subject to availability and while stocks last.<br />
                                        Edible shall not be liable to any customer or household for any financial loss arising out of the refusal, cancellation or withdrawal of any eCoupon or any failure or inability of a customer or household to use an e-Coupon for any reason.
                                    </p>
                                <li>Miscellaneous
                                    <p>We reserve the right to vary or terminate the operation of any eCoupon at any time without notice.<br />
                                        The failure of Edible to take any action in respect of a breach of these terms and conditions shall not constitute a waiver of their enforceablility. Edible reserves its rights in respect of these terms and conditions at all times.
                                    </p></ol>
